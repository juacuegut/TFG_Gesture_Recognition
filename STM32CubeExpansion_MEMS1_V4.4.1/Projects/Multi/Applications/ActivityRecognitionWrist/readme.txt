@par Example Description 

Main function is to show how to use Activity Recognition for Wrist library to estimate
activity performed by user by using accelerometer only.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on Sensor expansion board attached to STM32F401RE, STM32L152RE or STM32L476RG devices.
  - If you power the Nucleo board via USB 3.0 port, please check that you have flashed the last version of
    the firmware of ST-Link v2 inside the Nucleo board. In order to flash the last available firmware of the
	ST-Link v2, you can use the STM32 ST Link Utility.
  - If you have the DIL24 expansion component with the LSM6DS3 sensor and you want to enable the LSM6DS3 sensor,
    plug the component into the DIL24 interface; otherwise the LSM6DS0 sensor is enabled by default.
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F401RE RevC, NUCLEO-L152RE RevC and NUCLEO-L476RE RevC and
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ?

This package contains projects for IAR IDEs viz. In order to make the
program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V7.80.4).
 - Open the IAR project file EWARM\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\Project.eww or EWARM\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\Project.eww or
    EWARM\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Project.eww according to the target board used.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For µVision:
 - Open µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.22.0).
 - Open the µVision project file MDK-ARM\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx or MDK-ARM\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx or
    MDK-ARM\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx according the target board used.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For System Workbench:
 - Open System Workbench for STM32 (this firmware has been successfully tested with System Workbench for STM32 Version 1.13.1.201701200843).
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the System
   Workbench project is located (it should be SW4STM32\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\STM32F4xx-ActivityRecognitionWrist or SW4STM32\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\STM32L1xx-Nucleo-ActivityRecognitionWrist
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
